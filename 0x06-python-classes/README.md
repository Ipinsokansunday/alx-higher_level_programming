# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object oriented programming. A class creates 
a new type where objects are instances of the class. An analogy is that you 
can have variables of type int which translates to saying that variables that store 
integers are variables which are instances (objects) of the int class

Objects can store data using ordinary variables that belong to the object. 
Variables that belong to an object or class are referred to as fields
